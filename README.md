# PyRS
Python Bot for RuneScape

So this is a bot that I made for the game runescape. It got me up to 74 mining before I got bored of using it and quit the game permanently.
The basic idea behind how this works is that I register the location of some clicks (on the screen), and then I run the bot with those exact clicks repeating over and over again.
